# Atomtronic transistor using the GP equation.
This repository contains code to investigate the atomtronic transistor using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Specifically I want to test the resonance tunneling and coherence of the matter wave in the drain well of the transistor (https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.104.033311). This repository is for personal use and is not maintained very well.
